I am an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals. I joined KFUPM in 2022 after obtaining a PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I worked with [Seth Hutchinson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/), [Girish Krishnan](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/gkrishna), and [Mohammed-Ali Belabbas](https://publish.illinois.edu/belabbas/). I obtained my MS in 2015 from KFUPM, where I worked with [Ali Muqaibel](https://sites.google.com/view/muqaibel).

My current research focuses on the overlap of robotics and machine vision. More specifically, I am interested in visual servoing and sensor fusion applied to agricultural and marine applications. I am also interested in some specific remote sensing applications.

This project aims to develop a modular AUV that can be used for various applications such as seafloor surveying, sea creature analysis, pipe inspection, and underwater manipulation tasks.

Summary
========
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have become increasingly important in underwater inspection and surveying applications. This project aims to develop a modular AUV that can be used for various applications such as pipe inspection, seafloor surveying, sea creature analysis, and underwater manipulation tasks.
The development of this AUV will be a stepping-stone to future projects that include developing and implementing perception and control algorithms for the AUV and implementing inspection and investigation tasks.

Project Goals:
------------
The goals of this project are to:
* Develop a modular AUV design that is easy to customize and upgrade.
* Integrate a variety of sensors into the AUV, including an IMU, camera, and sonar.
* Develop a power system for the AUV that provides a continuous operation for up to 3 hours.
* Develop a software architecture for the AUV based on Robotic Operating System (ROS).
* Develop a communication system for the AUV that allows it to communicate with a surface station using various methods.

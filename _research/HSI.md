I am developing a low-cost hyperspectral imaging system that will be used for agriculture purposes.

Summary
========
his research proposal aims to develop a Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) system that effectively balances affordability and performance, specifically tailored for the agricultural sector.
Through the integration of available components and innovative processing methods, this project seeks to make HSI accessible to a wider audience in agriculture, leading to significant
improvements in precision farming, crop health monitoring, and resource optimization. 

The research plan comprises several key objectives. Firstly, we will carefully research and select hyperspectral camera components optimized for the agricultural field. We will take
into account factors such as spectral range, spatial resolution, and sensitivity to ensure that we capture accurate data. Next, we will develop precise calibration protocols to guarantee
consistent and reliable measurements from the HSI system, maintaining data accuracy and trustworthiness.

A cornerstone of our proposal is the development of methods for data acquisition, processing, and spectral analysis. The developed software should enable researchers, regardless
of their technical expertise, to effectively harness the potential of hyperspectral data. It is crucial to validate the HSI system developed in this research in actual agricultural settings.
To achieve this, we will create an experimental setup and gather hyperspectral data to evaluate the system’s performance for agriculture applications. This testing phase will provide
valuable insights into the system’s effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios.

This research proposal aims to overcome the challenges of cost and complexity associated with HSI system development. The goal is to provide farmers, researchers, and stakeholders
with a powerful tool that enables new levels of insight in precision farming, crop health monitoring, and resource optimization. While this proposal primarily focuses on agriculture
applications, its potential extension to other domains remains viable.

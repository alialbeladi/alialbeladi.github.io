This project aims to develop a low-cost hyperspectral imaging system that will be used for agriculture applications.

Summary
========
The main goal of this research is to create a hyperspectral imaging solution that is affordable and designed specifically for the needs of the agricultural industry. The proposed system will be developed using a combination of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and custom-built components. The COTS components will be used to provide the basic functionality of the system. The custom-built components will be used to improve the systemâ€™s performance, such as the calibration system and the software that controls the system.

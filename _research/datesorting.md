This project aims to develop a machine vision system that sorts dates based on size, color, moisture, and skin quality.

Summary
========
The goal of this proposal is to develop a compact low-cost machine that automates date fruit
sorting and grading for small- and medium-sized farms. The innovation lies in building a smart
agricultural system where the following technologies converge: Machine Vision, Smart Actuation,
Data Analysis, and Internet of Things. An initial prototype of the desired system has been developed
and tested in farms and an enhanced version is under development.

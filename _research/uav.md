I am developing an AUV 

Summary
========
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have become increasingly important in underwater inspection and surveying applications. The proposed project aims to develop a modular AUV that can be used for various applications such as pipe inspection, seafloor surveying, sea creature analysis, and underwater manipulation tasks.
The project will focus on developing the mechanical design, actuation system, sensors, power system, software architecture, and communication system. More specifically, the AUV will be modular in design, allowing for easy customization and upgrades. It will be equipped with a variety of sensors that will enable it to navigate in complex underwater environments., including an inertial measurement unit (IMU), camera, and sonar. The power system will be designed to provide long battery life while minimizing weight and size. The software architecture for the system will be designed to enable easy customization and integration with other systems. The communication system will be designed to provide reliable communication between the vehicle and the operator.
The development of this AUV will be a steppingstone to future projects that include  developing and implementing control algorithms for the AUV (e.g. attitude controllers, path following algorithms, and visual servoing controllers) and implementing inspection and investigation tasks.

Project Goals:
------------
The goals of this project are to:
* Develop a modular AUV design that is easy to customize and upgrade.
* Integrate a variety of sensors into the AUV, including an IMU, camera, and sonar.
* Develop a power system for the AUV that provides a continuous operation for up to 3 hours.
* Develop a software architecture for the AUV based on Robotic Operating System (ROS).
* Develop a communication system for the AUV that allows it to communicate with a surface station using a variety of methods.
